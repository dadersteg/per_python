# Coding Preferences for Jules
- Always use Python 3.12+ features.
- Include Google-style docstrings for every function.
- Ensure all code is PEP8 compliant.
- Use 'logging' instead of 'print' statements for errors.
- If you find a more efficient library (like Polars instead of Pandas), suggest it.
